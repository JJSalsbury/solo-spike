## Synopsis

I researched several possibilities for implementing charts and graphs into my application and came across React-Vis,
created by Uber and built with React and D3. React-Vis is said to be one of the easiest React charting libraries to get started with. I found React-vis relatively easy to work with. The components provided by react-vis function in a similar way to other react components, with props, children, and callbacks.

## To use React-Vis

I created a CRA and installed the React-Vis library using NPM. Then, I was able to explore different charts and figure out their implementation.

## Take Away

I can use this library to implement charts into my project.

NOTE: After further research, another option would be to use Chart.css. Charts.css is a new open source framework for data visualization. It replaces traditional JS charting libraries with a CSS framework. With a few simple CSS classes applied on the container element you can turn your entire table of data into a chart. The framework is developer-friendly making it easy to customize every element with simple CSS selectors.

<!-- ### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
